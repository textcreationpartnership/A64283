         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It would ſeeme incredible to many, if one ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to them but one half of that which the Lord hath done for us, which we have ſeene, and know to be moſt true; we can ſubſcribe a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum eſt</hi> to the ſoveraigne vertue of faſting &amp; prayer, whereby <hi>Iſrael</hi>-like we had power with God and with men, and prevailed, <hi>Geneſ. 32.28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now <hi>Satan</hi> envying at our proſperity, and having great wrath, becauſe he knew his time was but ſhort, found out new stratagems ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for his destructive ends. Firſt now was a new court of delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes erected by arbitrary power among you, in the room of the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion formerly by authority deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this was the ſame with the former (and far worſe) the name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:110515:5"/> being altered, and rightly was it termed by ſome, <hi>a ſpaniſh inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by others the <hi>Abomination of deſolation.</hi> The men authorized to be Judges in this delicate Court were ſuch as profeſſed themſelves to ſtand for the intereſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebells, one of them boldly affirming in the pulpit in your hearing and mine (as by diverſe ſufficient witneſſes can be proved) that <hi>Theſe Warrs</hi> are for <hi>us Biſhops,</hi> which Maxime had beene formerly divulged among the people, but more ſecretly. Whereupon <hi>Dr</hi> Beadle, <hi>Biſh.</hi> of <hi>Kilmore</hi> a moſt worthy and learned man in a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indignation againſt the ſame when he firſt heard thereof, burſt out into this expreſſion, If we <hi>B<hi rend="sup">ps</hi>
               </hi> be the cauſe of this horrible tempeſt, let them take us, and, with <hi>Jonah,</hi> caſt us all over board. Another of the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, being an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man by birth, in the ſame pulpit excuſed the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented gentlemen, meaning the rebels his countrimen, diſſwading
<pb facs="tcp:110515:5"/> the Soldiers from vigorous proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and the Judges from condemning ſuch of them as had beene taken priſoners in open hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, unleſs two or three witneſſes ſhould firſt depoſe, that to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſaid priſoners had before in cold blood committed things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, whereas we all know that thoſe bloody Canibals murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man woman &amp; child, except here one, and there another, eſcaped by Gods extraordinary preſervation, as one of Jobs ſervants eſcaped from the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and another from the ſword of the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> onely to bring the ſad tydings to their Maſter of what had been done to the reſt of his ſervants, and to his cattell. At the ſame time did this merciful Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, directing his words to me who then ſate before him, with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger pointing at me, condemne all bloody preaching and praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them who he ſaid were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and admoniſhed me and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:110515:6"/> from uſing the like for future time: whereas our Preaching was to animate the ſoldiers Couragiouſly to proſecute ſo juſt a warre againſt ſuch unparalleld murtherers; and our Prayers were, that the righteous God would teach their hands to war and their fingers to fight, what other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he uſed, I have in writing, atteſted by the hands of good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>A third man, was a civilian, who had been unhappily intercepted from going beyond ſea to be bred a Jeſuite, yet retained his Jeſuitical principles. Theſe with ſome others <hi>ejuſdem fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furis</hi> with their revived oath <hi>ex-officio,</hi> impriſoned ſome, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or drove to flight others, to the number of fourteen in one week, ſome whereof might be truely called, <hi>The Horſmen</hi> and Chariots of your <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſtood day and night in the gap for you, being able, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diligent miniſters of the Goſpel, beſides many others who were
<pb facs="tcp:110515:6"/> driven away by this tempeſt.</p>
            <p>After this, a new project, of far more dangerous Conſequence, was promoted by a faction in the army ſiding with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> party: to wit a curſed Ceſſation was hatched to be made with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebels, when we were maſters in the field, and our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was maintained moſtly by the ſpoiles which they dayly recovered from the enemy, who had formerly made a prey of all the eſtates of the Engliſh throughout the land, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few cityes and caſtles which ſtood out upon their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and could onely preſerve ſuch goods as they had within the walls in moſt places.</p>
            <p>The very mention of this deſigne was odious to all the remnant of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, who utterly abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thought of ever ſhaking hands with ſuch a barbarous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, or rather incarnate devils, who had robbed them of all, burnt their dwellings, murthered
<pb facs="tcp:110515:7"/> their wives, children, and kinſfolk, after they had exerciſed upon them all imaginable cruelties, as full well you know. And all that had but half an eye foreſaw what the iſſue of this would be, as afterwards the event manifeſted, even a deadly ſnare to our ſide: now were our brave ſoldiers left to ſtarve in their garriſons, many of them puniſhed with death by their owne diſaffected officers upon the leaſt complaint of any of their inhumane perfidious enemies; whileſt they were free to kill, rob and ſpoile at pleaſure without controule, and hereby had they opportunityes of recruiting themſelves with freſh men and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for a new war, when the ceſſation ſhould be expired: now were foure of our beſt friends privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors clapt up in the Caſtle of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin for oppoſing the Ceſſation; when all the rebels who had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, having beene taken priſoners by our army in the open field, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, and ſome of them dubbed
<pb facs="tcp:110515:7"/> (forſooth) for their good ſervice; and more of our Miniſters were driven to follow their brethren to ſhift for their lives and ſafety by flight: ſome for preaching and praying againſt the Treaty, as in duty and conſcience they thought themſelves bound to doe: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for feare leſt they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, if it tooke effect. Thus were we (like Levi) divided in Jacob, and ſcattered in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>But ſince my departing from you, I have beene exceedingly deſirous to returne to you, inſomuch as I once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as for as Neſſon towards you, and thence was turned back; how ever I am ſtill mindfull of you, in my Prayers on all occaſions, ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing with you; in your ſtraits and dangers have I condoled with you, and joyfull have I been and ſtill am at your deliverances and enjoyments of mercies, as at the preſent to heare of your welfare, that the Lord hath placed over you a prudent, well principled and religious governour
<pb facs="tcp:110515:8"/> in chiefe, and others ſubordinate magiſtrates men of Courage, fearing God, hating covetuouſneſs; that the Lord hath stored you with able, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable, orthodox divines. And in teſtimony of my thankfulneſs I ſend unto you (ſince I may not come over to you my ſelf) this ſmall tract have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts of preparing a larger treatiſe for you upon a ſubject which I made entrance upon, while I was among you, entitled <hi>The way of ſalvation,</hi> which may therefore more properly be layed claime unto, by you; as this preſent Treatiſe more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belongeth to my now pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners of <hi>Eaſt Greenwich,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom moſt of the contents hereof have been publiſhed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſermons in the pulpit; though here much contracted, and in other particulars enlarged.</p>

I ſhall not deteine you long in this praeludium, as I have done my remote friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have me dayly with you upon all occaſions to ſpeak unto you <hi>viva voce.</hi> Onely thus much I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſignify to you in as publike a
<pb facs="tcp:110515:9"/> manner, as I could deviſe, that I am yours, and moſt unfainedly do I deſire, and accordingly (by the Lords aſſiſtance) I ſhall endeavour the ſpiritual and eternal welfare both of you and yours in ſtriving to remove all the hinderances thereof, and in faithfully revealing to you all the whole counſell of God, that I may be kept cleare from the blood of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls, and ſo ſave my ſelf, and them that heare me; for, for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end do I deſire to live among you, and for this I humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly implore your dayly Prayers to God for me.

For albeit it is likely (ſaith he) that they were not altogether dumb, yet becauſe their confeſſion was not inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous or free enough, the Evangeliſt-abſolutely denieth that they profeſſed their faith.

The Queſt. then remaineth yet in force, How can the aſſertion of our Saviour be juſtified, where he affirmeth of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Nathanael,</hi> that there was no guile in them, ſince it is cleerely proved, that there hath been and ever
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110515:52"/> will be falſhood found in all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen of <hi>Adam</hi> excepting <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, <hi>who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As we have before diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed of guile in generall, ſo here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine we muſt diſtinguiſh of ſinfull guile, 1. There is groſs &amp; hidden fraud.</p>
            <p>Secondly; ſuch as men approve of in themſelves; and ſuch as they allow not of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; There is guile continued in, or truly repented of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; there is ſuch guile as God imputeth to the party in whom it reſideth: or ſuch as he chargeth not at all upon them in whom it is.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There may be guile in the fleſh when there is none in the ſpirit Now it is granted that this ſin hath infected all mankind by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture except <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> yea that there remaine ſome dregs of Hypocriſie in the beſt of the children of man, while they live in this world. But as for groſſe falſhood, it ſeldome or never ſurpriſeth the true Chriſtian, unleſſe it be while he is under ſome ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or other, as here <hi>Jacob</hi> was, for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110515:52"/> 1. his dear Mother perſwaded him to take this ſiniſter courſe for obtaining the bleſſing; the end was good, he ſaw his mother counſel'd him to it in great love to him, he might haply imagin, that his mother being withal a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman knew better than himſelfe what was both lawfull and expedient (in ſuch a caſe) to be done, &amp; he knew that obedience was due to her that bare him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. eſpecially when ſhe was ſo importunate, and had taken the curſe upon her (which ſhe feared he ſhould haue brought upon himſelfe by this colluſion) for me had ſaid unto him, <hi>Upon me be thy curſe, my Son: Onely obey my voice, Geneſis.</hi> 27.13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here carnal reaſon for the preſent overtopt his faith, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, The bleſſing is promiſed to me, and now is the time or never for me to ſeek it, leſt my brother prevent me, and this is the moſt probable way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here (we may be ſure) Satan would not be wanting to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his utmoſt policy to thruſt him forward. And thus was he drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110515:53"/> the ſinne; yet got the bleſſing in this ſinfull method, to teach us all, that all our bleſſings proceed from Gods meer grace towards us in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and not for any worthineſſe of our own: though <hi>Jacob</hi> here did that which might juſtly have forfeited the bleſſing, yet even then did the <hi>Lord</hi> graciouſly confer it upon him, 2. Though he feared hereby to bring a curſe upon himſelfe, which plainly argueth ſtrong doubting in him; yet this hindreth not his ſpeeding. Where obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that theoreme of the Apoſtle to be a ſolid truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>If we believe not,</hi> yet <hi>God abideth faithfull</hi> he <hi>cannot deny himſelfe.</hi> Though we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never ſo much; yet God is the ſame moſt faithfull and juſt in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and undertakings.</p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide this time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> temptation, I conjecture that you ſhal hardly find him offending in this kind either before or after: Some may aske? Did he not ſupplant his brother? Anſw. <hi>Eſau</hi> indeed termed him a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planter to his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> deſcanting upon his name <hi>Jacob</hi> which ſignifieth a <hi>ſupplanter, Gen.</hi> 27.36. ſaying Is he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110515:53"/> not <hi>rightly named Jacob?</hi> for he hath <hi>ſupplanted me</hi> theſe two times: he took away my birthright, and behold now he hath taken <hi>away my Bleſſing alſo.</hi> But learned interpreters both Orthodox and popiſh herein juſtifie <hi>Jacob</hi> and condemne. <hi>Eſau.</hi>

               <hi>Paraeus</hi> aſſerteth that <hi>Jacob</hi> uſed pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not without a divine inſtinct, but no ſinfull guile: and againe he cleereth him of injuſtice in this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he bought not <hi>rem alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, ſed ſuam redemit;</hi> for without doubt (ſaith he) <hi>Eſau</hi> had often offered him the birthright, and this he gathereth from thoſe words Sell <hi>to me this day,</hi> ſwear to <hi>me this day, Gen.</hi> 25.31.33. <hi>q.d.</hi> Now performe to me, what thou haſt often promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, although there is hidden guile, and may be ſometimes groſſe fraud (in the times of temptation) in a true Chriſtian; yet when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth it in himſelfe, and after the temptation is paſt, he alloweth not of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110515:54"/> it in himſelf, as the wicked do, <hi>e.g. Ephraim</hi> juſtifieth himſelf in his leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7. He is a merchant, the <hi>balances of deceit are</hi> in his hand: he loveth to oppreſſe. And what ſaith he to this? <hi>v.</hi> 8. yet am I become rich, I have found me out ſubſtance in all my <hi>labours they ſhall find none iniquity in me, that were ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly The wicked continueth in this ſin, as the Pſalmiſt chargeth him; Thou <hi>giveſt thy mouth to evil,</hi> and thy <hi>tongue frameth deceit, Pſalm.</hi> 50.19. But aſſoone as the Lord bringeth a ſoul to true repentance, either initial, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, then he confeſſeth his fault with ſorrow and ſhame, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luk</hi> 19.8. If I have taken any thing from any man <hi>by falſe accuſation,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him fourfold. And <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had denied with ſwearing and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he knew his maſter, he went out and wept bitterly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.70.72.75. and with David he prayeth the Lord to remove from him <hi>the way of Lying, Pſal.</hi> 119.29. and thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he renounceth the hidden things of dishoneſty, and walketh no longer in craftineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. but ſtudiouſly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110515:54"/> according to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> rule <hi>he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away lying,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaketh the truth with his neighbour,</hi> knowing that we are members one of another.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. And though there remaineth <hi>guile</hi> in his fleſh, or unregenerate part; yet is there none <hi>in his ſpirit,</hi> or rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>In his ſpirit there is no guile,</hi> This diſtinction Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh when he found in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf experimentally a bitter-ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>In me,</hi> that is <hi>in my fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) dwelleth no good thing: for <hi>to will is preſent with me,</hi> but how to performe that which is good, I find not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 22. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the law of God, after <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man:</hi> But I ſee another law in <hi>my members,</hi> warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly Though there <hi>be guile in him;</hi> yet (after his repentance for it) the Lord doth <hi>not impute</hi> it to him: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the royal-prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.12. Bleſſed is the man, whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered. Bleſſed is he unto whom <hi>the Lord imputeth not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110515:55"/> iniquity,</hi> in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile. He will confeſs of himſelf, I have a treacherous heart, and falſe tongue, who ſhall deliver me from it? I will do this thing for thee, ſaith the Lord, which you deſireſt; for I have found a ranſome. Oh this maketh him to cry out with the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle, Bleſſed be God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Thus God dealt with the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> c. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5. Wo is me, (ſaith he) for I am undone, becauſe I am <hi>a man of unclean lips,</hi> and I dwel in the midſt of a people of <hi>unclean lips:</hi> for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſtes. Then flew one of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> unto me, having a live coale in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he laid it upon my mouth, and ſaid, Lo, this hath <hi>touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged,</hi> v. 6.7. Here I cannot preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Nathanael</hi> in my text, in whom there was rooted a very dangerous Error (as before hath been ſhewed) that <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt was not the right <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe he came out of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> yet our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> foreſeeing that after he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110515:55"/> was better informed, he would embrace the truth; by way of anticipation (as I may ſo ſpeake) gives him this report, that he was a <hi>true Iſraelite in whom was no guile.</hi> Upon which words<note n="*" place="margin">Laudat in eo cando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, in profitendâ animi ſui ſententiâ.
